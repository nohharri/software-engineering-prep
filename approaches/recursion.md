# Recursion

* Recursion usually becomes either top-down or bottom-up solutions. This means the answer is at times at the bottom, or at the very top of the function stack. This is dependent on how the function is implemented.

## Sum Problems

* Functions that calculate sums typically work best as bottom up solutions. This indicates that the answer is at the top.

## Possible Paths

* Where you're looking for different permutations or paths, the answer typically exists at the bottom.
